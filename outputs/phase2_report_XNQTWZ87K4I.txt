[1] 5.0s - semantic (conf: 0.47)
    information data privacy laws?

[2] 20.8s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    So, one of them is that do you have a cookie banner,

[3] 24.1s - semantic (conf: 0.49)
    which blocked cookies before you have explicit consent?

[4] 27.8s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    Okay, I want to show you how it can be done.

[5] 31.5s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    So, if you take a look on this website right here,

[6] 35.8s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    we have a cookie banner, which communicates the privacy notice,

[7] 40.3s - semantic (conf: 0.46)
    and also you have to embed the ability to block cookies

[8] 52.0s - semantic (conf: 0.52)
    Basically, be able to block cookies before you have received explicit consent.

[9] 56.4s - semantic (conf: 0.48)
    Okay, another best practice you want to have included in your banner

[10] 64.8s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    the cookie banner, as you see right here.

[11] 71.4s - semantic (conf: 0.41)
    of being transparent with the data we collect.

[12] 75.1s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    So, we have what we call a detailed cookie banner.

[13] 78.0s - semantic (conf: 0.51)
    So, you can take details and you can see what type of cookies and plugins

[14] 106.7s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    Okay, now that's one of the areas we want to walk through in terms of the cookie banner.

[15] 111.6s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    A second part is have you made it easy to withdraw consent?

[16] 121.8s - semantic (conf: 0.71)
    So, in this case, let's say that I have now consented for the cookies and trackers.

[17] 126.9s - semantic (conf: 0.63)
    Now, how do you actually change the consent?

[18] 132.1s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    Now, you may have difficulty because of the little widget down here.

[19] 150.9s - semantic (conf: 0.52)
    but also opt out and basically change the users previously given consent as well.

[20] 157.7s - semantic (conf: 0.61)
    And that's something we document inside our back end as well.

[21] 161.6s - semantic (conf: 0.46)
    Okay, so that's a way to communicate additional privacy information,

[22] 164.8s - semantic (conf: 0.51)
    but also to be very transparent and provide the ability for the user to withdraw consent at a later time.

[23] 173.7s - semantic (conf: 0.61)
    So, that is the second point.

[24] 176.0s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    Now, the third point is do you have evidence of valid consent?

[25] 181.2s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    I want to show you how it looks inside the administration panel.

[26] 184.6s - regex (conf: 0.95)
    So, if I go to consent tracking and let's say I now press refresh right here,

[27] 198.3s - semantic (conf: 0.68)
    So, you can basically see that I have declined and we now have a record of the consent in real time,

[28] 205.1s - semantic (conf: 0.45)
    documented by a secure privacy as well.

[29] 207.7s - semantic (conf: 0.41)
    So, that's something you have to have in mind when you implement a GDPR,

[30] 213.9s - semantic (conf: 0.41)
    E privacy, or LTPD solution for your websites and your company.
