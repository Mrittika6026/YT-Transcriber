[00:05] information data privacy laws?
[00:07] Again, and again, we've seen the same common mistakes on, you know,
[00:12] hundreds and thousands of websites.
[00:14] So, I want to go through three very common mistakes in this video
[00:17] to make sure that you don't do the same mistakes.
[00:20] So, one of them is that do you have a cookie banner,
[00:24] which blocked cookies before you have explicit consent?
[00:27] Okay, I want to show you how it can be done.
[00:31] So, if you take a look on this website right here,
[00:35] we have a cookie banner, which communicates the privacy notice,
[00:40] and also you have to embed the ability to block cookies
[00:44] before a user presses accept.
[00:48] Okay, so that's something your solution should be able to do.
[00:51] Basically, be able to block cookies before you have received explicit consent.
[00:56] Okay, another best practice you want to have included in your banner
[01:00] is not only the ability to accept, but also the client,
[01:04] the cookie banner, as you see right here.
[01:07] In this specific case right here, we have chosen an approach
[01:11] of being transparent with the data we collect.
[01:15] So, we have what we call a detailed cookie banner.
[01:18] So, you can take details and you can see what type of cookies and plugins
[01:23] we use on the website and your ability to change the dissentings right here.
[01:29] Other ways you can make it look and style to make it fit
[01:33] in a beautiful way to your website is like this.
[01:37] And here's another beautiful way to make it stylish and make it fit your website.
[01:42] So, you have a number of ways to make it look and feel perfect to your own website.
[01:46] Okay, now that's one of the areas we want to walk through in terms of the cookie banner.
[01:51] A second part is have you made it easy to withdraw consent?
[01:57] Okay, so from a technical aspect, this is quite complicated.
[02:01] So, in this case, let's say that I have now consented for the cookies and trackers.
[02:06] Now, how do you actually change the consent?
[02:12] Now, you may have difficulty because of the little widget down here.
[02:15] But we actually have what we call a trust badge,
[02:18] which you can move in different locations on the website.
[02:22] But what's really smart about it is that it is interactive.
[02:25] So, in the case of, let's say, analytics, it provides you an ability to opt in,
[02:30] but also opt out and basically change the users previously given consent as well.
[02:37] And that's something we document inside our back end as well.
[02:41] Okay, so that's a way to communicate additional privacy information,
[02:44] but also to be very transparent and provide the ability for the user to withdraw consent at a later time.
[02:51] Okay, so very important.
[02:53] So, that is the second point.
[02:56] Now, the third point is do you have evidence of valid consent?
[03:01] I want to show you how it looks inside the administration panel.
[03:04] So, if I go to consent tracking and let's say I now press refresh right here,
[03:11] you can then see that I have now declined for analytics right here.
[03:18] So, you can basically see that I have declined and we now have a record of the consent in real time,
[03:25] documented by a secure privacy as well.
[03:27] So, that's something you have to have in mind when you implement a GDPR,
[03:33] E privacy, or LTPD solution for your websites and your company.
[03:38] Okay, so, three common mistakes.
[03:39] Thanks. I hope it makes sense.
