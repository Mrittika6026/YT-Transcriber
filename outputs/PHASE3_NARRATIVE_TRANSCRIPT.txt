--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] So, how do you make a website compliant with GDPR and other
[00:05] information data privacy laws?
[00:07] Again, and again, we've seen the same common mistakes on, you know,
[00:12] hundreds and thousands of websites.
[00:14] So, I want to go through three very common mistakes in this video
[00:17] to make sure that you don't do the same mistakes.
[00:20] So, one of them is that do you have a cookie banner,
[00:24] which blocked cookies before you have explicit consent?
[00:27] Okay, I want to show you how it can be done.

UI ELEMENTS: Secure Privacy brand logo, Top navigation links (Support, Reseller, Login), Request Demo button, Website URL input field, Check my website button, Cookie consent banner with information text, Accept button (on cookie banner), Close button (X) on cookie banner, Cookie preference checkboxes (Analytics, Essential), Details dropdown for cookie settings

[ VISUAL SIGNAL @ 34.8s | ID: REF_004_F3 ]

UI ELEMENTS: Secure Privacy logo and branding, Website navigation links (Support, Reseller, Login, Request Demo), Headline: 'Tired of complex GDPR and Cookie laws?', Website URL input field, Button: 'Check my website', Cookie consent banner, Cookie consent message text, Button: 'Accept' (on cookie banner), Close button (X on cookie banner), Cookie category checkboxes: 'Analytics', 'Essential', Dropdown: 'Details' (for cookie settings), Speaker's webcam feed overlay, Video player controls
--------------------------------------------------

[00:31] So, if you take a look on this website right here,
[00:35] we have a cookie banner, which communicates the privacy notice,
[00:40] and also you have to embed the ability to block cookies
[00:44] before a user presses accept.
[00:48] Okay, so that's something your solution should be able to do.
[00:51] Basically, be able to block cookies before you have received explicit consent.
[00:56] Okay, another best practice you want to have included in your banner
[01:00] is not only the ability to accept, but also the client,
[01:04] the cookie banner, as you see right here.
[01:07] In this specific case right here, we have chosen an approach
[01:11] of being transparent with the data we collect.
[01:15] So, we have what we call a detailed cookie banner.

[ VISUAL SIGNAL @ 79.0s | ID: SEM_1012_F4 ]
TYPE: UI_Walkthrough/Settings
SCENE: The UI displays a website's cookie consent management system, showing an initial cookie banner at the top and an expanded, detailed view of cookie preferences below it.

--------------------------------------------------

[01:18] So, you can take details and you can see what type of cookies and plugins
[01:23] we use on the website and your ability to change the dissentings right here.
[01:29] Other ways you can make it look and style to make it fit
[01:33] in a beautiful way to your website is like this.
[01:37] And here's another beautiful way to make it stylish and make it fit your website.
[01:42] So, you have a number of ways to make it look and feel perfect to your own website.

[ VISUAL SIGNAL @ 110.6s | ID: REF_008_F5 ]
TYPE: Conceptual_Explanation
SCENE: A Google Slides presentation titled '3 common mistakes' is displayed. The current slide presents three critical questions related to cookie banner implementation, consent withdrawal, and evidence of valid consent, within the context of privacy compliance.
UI ELEMENTS: Google Slides presentation interface, Browser tabs (e.g., 'Secure Privacy GDPR', 'Understand.com'), Presentation slide with three numbered questions, Google Slides menu bar (File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Slide, Arrange, Tools, Add-ons, Help), Google Slides toolbar, Slide thumbnail pane (left side), Present button, Share button, Video player controls (play/pause, timestamp 01:50)
--------------------------------------------------

[01:46] Okay, now that's one of the areas we want to walk through in terms of the cookie banner.
[01:51] A second part is have you made it easy to withdraw consent?
[01:57] Okay, so from a technical aspect, this is quite complicated.

[ VISUAL SIGNAL @ 123.8s | ID: SEM_1015_F6 ]
TYPE: UI_Walkthrough
SCENE: The Secure Privacy website's landing page, introducing its GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD compliance solution. The page features a call-to-action to scan a website and an embedded video demonstrating the product's administrative dashboard and features.
UI ELEMENTS: Website URL input field, "Check my website" button, Header navigation links (Support, Reseller, Login, Request Demo), Embedded product demo video player, Admin dashboard elements within embedded video (e.g., sidebar menu items, data display with country flags)
--------------------------------------------------

[02:01] So, in this case, let's say that I have now consented for the cookies and trackers.
[02:06] Now, how do you actually change the consent?
[02:12] Now, you may have difficulty because of the little widget down here.
[02:15] But we actually have what we call a trust badge,
[02:18] which you can move in different locations on the website.
[02:22] But what's really smart about it is that it is interactive.

[ VISUAL SIGNAL @ 149.9s | ID: SEM_1018_F7 ]
TYPE: Settings
SCENE: The UI displays a modal dialog for configuring cookie consent and privacy settings within the 'Secure Privacy' platform (likely an administrator interface). It allows for managing the blocking or enabling of third-party analytical plugins and provides information about essential cookies.
UI ELEMENTS: Secure Privacy modal header, Description of 3rd party analytical software usage, Hotjar plugin entry with 'Block/Enable' toggle, Google Analytics plugin entry with 'Block/Enable' toggle, 'Essential' cookie category dropdown, 'Read our privacy policy' hyperlink, 'CANCEL' button, 'SAVE' button, Language selection dropdown (English), WordPress admin bar with 'Secure Privacy: GDPR, CCPA & Privacy' menu item, Browser tabs (including 'Secure Privacy: GDPR, CCPA & Privacy')
--------------------------------------------------

[02:25] So, in the case of, let's say, analytics, it provides you an ability to opt in,
[02:30] but also opt out and basically change the users previously given consent as well.
[02:37] And that's something we document inside our back end as well.
[02:41] Okay, so that's a way to communicate additional privacy information,
[02:44] but also to be very transparent and provide the ability for the user to withdraw consent at a later time.
[02:51] Okay, so very important.
[02:53] So, that is the second point.
[02:56] Now, the third point is do you have evidence of valid consent?

SCENE: Inside the main dashboard of Secure Privacy AI, displaying an overview of various privacy compliance features and their current activation and customization status.

Contact us here.'
--------------------------------------------------

[03:01] I want to show you how it looks inside the administration panel.
[03:04] So, if I go to consent tracking and let's say I now press refresh right here,
[03:11] you can then see that I have now declined for analytics right here.
[03:18] So, you can basically see that I have declined and we now have a record of the consent in real time,
[03:25] documented by a secure privacy as well.
[03:27] So, that's something you have to have in mind when you implement a GDPR,
[03:33] E privacy, or LTPD solution for your websites and your company.
[03:38] Okay, so, three common mistakes.
[03:39] Thanks. I hope it makes sense.
[03:41] Autolize with the habit to hear from you.
